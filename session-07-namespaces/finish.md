In this lab we've learned:
* how to create multiple namespaces to subdivide our cluster
** created 2 namespaces: development and production
* how to use Kubernetes context to easily switch between between the two namespaces
* to deploy pods to both namespaces
* resources users create in one namespace are hidden from the other namespace.
