## In this lab we've learned:
1. how to create multiple namespaces to subdivide our cluster
   * created 2 namespaces: development and production
2. how to use Kubernetes context to easily switch between between the two namespaces
3. to deploy pods to both namespaces
4. resources users create in one namespace are hidden from the other namespace.
